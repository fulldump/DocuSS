# DocuSS #

## What is it? ##

DocuSS is a tool to provide quality format to simple HTML documents. DocuSS adds margins, format, code highlighting, document metadata and automatic index.

## How it works? ##

DocuSS transforms the markup inside your browser and adds a set of CSS files. This document is using DocuSS, you can see the source code and how is transformed by inspecting the DOM.

## How can I use it? ##

Very simple: only the next line must be included in your 'head' section of your HTML document and all will work:

```
<script src="http://www.treeweb.es/ShareCode/preview/fc9ad45551a6e4b4d06e038fe9a6250b/js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
